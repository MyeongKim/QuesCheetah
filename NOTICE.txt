Python (https://www.python.org/)
=======================================================================

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/)
=======================================================================

MySQL Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs and VARs

Oracle provides its MySQL database server and MySQL Client Libraries under a dual license model
designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors 
(such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.

For OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications:

OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), 
VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine and distribute commercially licensed software
with MySQL software and do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software
under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter into a commercial
license agreement with Oracle.

For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications:

For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL that want to combine
and distribute those FOSS applications with MySQL software, Oracle’s MySQL open source software licensed
under the GPL is the best option.

For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license other than the GPL,
Oracle makes its GPL-licensed MySQL Client Libraries available under a FOSS Exception that enables
use of the those MySQL Client Libraries under certain conditions without causing the entire derivative work to be
subject to the GPL.
